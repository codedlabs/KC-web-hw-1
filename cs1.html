    <h3>What about Caribou?</h3>

    <p>
      Caribou Coffee founder, John Puckett, was working as a management
      consultant for Boston-based firm Bain & Company, helping develop ideas and
      strategies for other companies, when he decided he wanted to become an
      entrepreneur. After a trip to Denali National Park in Alaska, he and his
      wife, Kim, decided to raise money and start a coffee company. His wife
      stayed with a job at General Motors while John moved to Minnesota to find
      the first site and put together financing.
